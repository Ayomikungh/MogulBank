Mogul bank provided a csv file called "Bank_marketing.csv"
This files was used to implement a robust RDBMS database capable of aaccomodating data for future campaigns
The Pioneers team cleaned, reformated, and split this file, to save it in 3 separate files using Jupyter notebook
Finally, we wrote an SQL code to create and populate the 3 tables from the bank_marketing.csv file manually
Due to security concerns, SQL files were saved as multiline string variables so Mogul bank can use it to create databases on their end
